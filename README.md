# BUAN 4310 Project 2: Predicting credit risk 

## Problem 2 Stark Inc. Introduction:
After Steve Rogers replaced the Infinity Stones, Stark Enterprises has branched into the financial industry.
Perhaps Steve Rogers changed something when he traveled back in time 2. Since Mr. Stark is on a different 
timeline, they are short of analogical power. They would like to build a model and predict which customers
are likely to have high risk. 

## Objectives:
Regarding this problem, we will analyze a sample of the larger dataset 'credit_2.csv'. Based on the dataset, 
we will build and select an appropriate model for the company and predict the risk at the target variable 
of the new customers which was given in 'credit_test_2.csv'.

## Data Description:
The credit_2 dataset represents ten of thousands information from customers, which includes some key variables
like income, gender, education level, age, housing situation, family status, loan amount, and occupation.
